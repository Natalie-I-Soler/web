  <h2>Why Is Digital Art Cool?</h2>
    <p>
    Digital art is one of the coolest hobbies or careers you could ever hope to stumble upon.
    Digital art is not only a totally cool art medium, but it's also a creative outlet for artists
    who may not have an excess of materials to create with. The versatility of digital art depends
    on what kind of resources you have available, such as different digital art programs (<a href="https://procreate.art/">Procreate</a>, <a href="http://firealpaca.com/">FireAlpaca</a>, <a href="https://ibispaint.com/?lang=en-US">IbisPaint</a>),
    but thankfully there are a lot of great free programs available to the public, so it's very easy to get started!
    After someone actually gets started they can make as much art as they want to, as long as they have enough memory
    to store it!

  <h2>Pros & Cons of Digital Art</h2>
    <p>
    Some of the pros of doing digital art instead of traditional art is that there is a far wider variety of things
    that can be done with digital art in a far more efficient manner compared to traditional art, such as 
    creating perfect curves, gradients, and copying shapes. However, it takes a while for an artist to get familiarized
    with their program, so it takes longer to master working in that setting, whereas with traditional art it would just
    be learning techniques and concepts. If an artist is more used to using one medium more than the other, it could take
    a while for them to adjust to switching and some tendecies may stick with them (e.g. trying to press the undo button
    on a line when you've drawn it in pen). Using technology to create art like this does not make the artist "lazier" 
    as some traditional artists might say, but more orderly and able to effectively use their program as each component 
    can be seperated and organized into it's own place, providing a more controlled environment for the artist to work in.
